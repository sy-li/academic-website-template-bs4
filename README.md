# Free as in beer!
This template is free for you to use. It's licensed under MIT, as are most of the code libraries it employs to do its thing. However,  no  front-facing (on the parts of the website that people can see) attribution to me is necessary. Enjoy! And feel free to contact me if you get stuck with using it. Happy to answer questions about it.

# Cool, Cool, Cool ... How do I download it?
Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Click the green code button and select Download ZIP. Now it's yours on your local machine. Edit your heart out and upload to any server you like. Github pages is a great place to put it, in fact. Lots of tutorials out there explaining this.
